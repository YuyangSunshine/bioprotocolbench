For example, mark sequential wells of a 24- well plate as culture time points or as 0h , vehicle control (C), drug treated (T) (Figure 1B ii). NOTE: Do not disturb or pull the tumor tissue while collecting a slice, as this will alter the tumor’s orientation with respect to the angle of the blade, leading to inconsistencies in the thicknesses of the subsequent slices.",

Dip the flat slide in a drop of cyanoacrylate adhesive. Mount this side onto the vibratome’s specimen holder so that the tumor faces the blade in an upright position. Let the glue dry for 2-3 min. NOTE: The normal lung tissue glued to the specimen holder does not interfere with tumor tissue slicing, and slicing is stopped before the normal tissue is reached. The tumor tissue sometimes bends due to the spongy texture of the normal lung tissue glued to the specimen holder, compromising its upright position. If this happens, glue a piece of additional normal lung support tissue next to the pre-mounted normal lung tissue to retain the tumor in an upright position (Figure 1A iii).",
            "When all slices are collected, transfer them onto titanium grids (2-3 slices per grid) placed in a 6-well plate containing 2.5mL of culture medium per well. Make sure that no air bubbles are formed between the titanium grid and the medium. 1. To load a slice on to the grid, keep the 6-well plate in an angled position so that a portion of the medium covers the grid, and place the slice in the medium on the grid; use forceps to spread the slice if it curls. Load the 6-well plates onto the rotating incubation unit placed inside a humidified incubator maintained at 37°C with 95% air and 5% C O_2 , and start the rotation cycle (Figure 1C i-ii). NOTE: Metallic grids and 6-well plates need to be accurately weight balanced before turning on the rotating unit. It is important to position the slices in the middle of the grid so that they fully alternate between the air and liquid phases during the rotation cycles. Slices that are placed too low or high are not appropriately exposed to oxygen or nutrients (Figure 1C i), which can compromise tissue viability. It is important to follow the position of the slice on the grid during cultivation, as the slice can occasionally slide down. If this happens within _1-2h of culture onset, correct its position and note down that this sample may be damaged. Slices that are mispositioned for an extended period of time should be discarded, as tissue viability is significantly affected by improper oxygenation and nutrient supply.",

Collect at least three reference slices to represent the top, middle and center of the tissue being sliced. Fix the 0h slices immediately and process as described in 5.1. NOTE: If the number of slices is limited, e.g., if multiple compound treatments or technical replicates are done, comparisons of each treated sample with its neighboring 0h sample can be difficult. In such cases, use the nearest 0 h slice (at least 400-600 um apart) to assess relative tissue viability or expression of relevant markers at culture onset.",

Bring the vibratome blade to the slicing position, set the slicing window and start slicing. NOTE: Slicing settings need to be adjusted according to the hardness of the tissue. Hard tissue is easier to slice than softer tissue, and softer tissues requires slicing with lower speed (0.1-0.12m s) and higher amplitude (2.6-2.8). A 4-5mm large tumor typically provides 15–20 slices of 200uM thickness. For short-term cultivation, murine tumors can be sliced under semi-sterile conditions outside the laminar hood.

            "When all slices are collected, transfer them onto titanium grids (2-3 slices per grid) placed in a 6-well plate containing 2.5mL of culture medium per well. Make sure that no air bubbles are formed between the titanium grid and the medium. 1. To load a slice on to the grid, keep the 6-well plate in an angled position so that a portion of the medium covers the grid, and place the slice in the medium on the grid; use forceps to spread the slice if it curls. Load the 6-well plates onto the rotating incubation unit placed inside a humidified incubator maintained at 37°C with 95% air and 5% C O_2 , and start the rotation cycle (Figure 1C i-ii). NOTE: Metallic grids and 6-well plates need to be accurately weight balanced before turning on the rotating unit. It is important to position the slices in the middle of the grid so that they fully alternate between the air and liquid phases during the rotation cycles. Slices that are placed too low or high are not appropriately exposed to oxygen or nutrients (Figure 1C i), which can compromise tissue viability. It is important to follow the position of the slice on the grid during cultivation, as the slice can occasionally slide down. If this happens within _1-2h of culture onset, correct its position and note down that this sample may be damaged. Slices that are mispositioned for an extended period of time should be discarded, as tissue viability is significantly affected by improper oxygenation and nutrient supply.",
            "Collect a tissue slice adjacent to the cultured slices as a 0h , uncultured, reference. Collect at least three reference slices to represent the top, middle and center of the tissue being sliced. Fix the 0h slices immediately and process as described in 5.1. NOTE: If the number of slices is limited, e.g., if multiple compound treatments or technical replicates are done, comparisons of each treated sample with its neighboring 0h sample can be difficult. In such cases, use the nearest 0 h slice (at least 400-600 um apart) to assess relative tissue viability or expression of relevant markers at culture onset.",
            "For long-term cultivation, replenish the culture medium every day. Lift the grid containing the tissue slices using sterile forceps, and place it in an empty well of the 6-well plate; replace 70% of the medium with fresh culture medium, and place the grid back in the medium. Continue the rotation cycle as explained in step 3.6."

The main purpose of this step is to assess the purity of the isolated cell populations after CD3 magnetic antibody separation. For this purpose established B and T cell markers, fluorophore-conjugated monoclonal antibodies CD20-FITC and CD2-APC, are used. Also the inclusion of isotype control antibodies is highly recommended to distinguish the non-specific “background” binding of the CD2 and CD20 antibodies (see step 4.8). Note 2: It is possible to keep the purified cell fractions in a 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution in the dark at 4°C until the time of staining (e.g., next day). Also the same procedure is applicable if there is a time gap between staining and FACS analysis.

            "Obtaining specimens or tissues of the appropriate developmental stage Obtain specimens for analysis at the time in development when the gene expression pattern(s) of interest occur(s) endogenously, hence the time when the CRE under investigation should activate reporter gene expression. For Drosophila, this can be either embryonic, larval, pupal or adult stages. Below we describe a method to stage adult and metamorphic flies; the latter of which takes place inside the puparium, a hard larval skin that contains the immobile specimen until it ecloses as an adult. A. Expand transgenic lines to ensure specimens of the proper stage are available when ready to analyze reporter gene expression by confocal microscopy. Set up two vials each with several (˜5- 10) male and female flies. On alternating days, bump the flies from one of the vials to an unused vial. Repeat this for a week. By the end of two weeks, transgenic fruit flies will be available that range from larval to adult developmental stages. B. Staging adult flies: The duration of time spent inside a puparium is 98 hours for females and 102 hours for males when reared at 25°C . Adult flies can be easily collected when they emerge from the puparium (called eclosion). This timepoint can be considered 0 hours post eclosion. Adult flies can be reared until the required timepoint for analysis. For example, a CRE called mel-oe1 that controls expression of the desatF gene in the adult oenocytes of D. melanogaster females is not active immediately after eclosion but CRE activity switches on after one day14.

            "Obtaining specimens or tissues of the appropriate developmental stage Obtain specimens for analysis at the time in development when the gene expression pattern(s) of interest occur(s) endogenously, hence the time when the CRE under investigation should activate reporter gene expression. For Drosophila, this can be either embryonic, larval, pupal or adult stages. Below we describe a method to stage adult and metamorphic flies; the latter of which takes place inside the puparium, a hard larval skin that contains the immobile specimen until it ecloses as an adult. A. Expand transgenic lines to ensure specimens of the proper stage are available when ready to analyze reporter gene expression by confocal microscopy. Set up two vials each with several (˜5- 10) male and female flies. On alternating days, bump the flies from one of the vials to an unused vial. Repeat this for a week. By the end of two weeks, transgenic fruit flies will be available that range from larval to adult developmental stages. B. Staging adult flies: The duration of time spent inside a puparium is 98 hours for females and 102 hours for males when reared at 25°C . Adult flies can be easily collected when they emerge from the puparium (called eclosion). This timepoint can be considered 0 hours post eclosion. Adult flies can be reared until the required timepoint for analysis. For example, a CRE called mel-oe1 that controls expression of the desatF gene in the adult oenocytes of D. melanogaster females is not active immediately after eclosion but CRE activity switches on after one day14. When the correct stage is obtained, anesthetize flies and situate in a drop of Halocarbon oil on a slide and proceed to confocal evaluation. C. Staging specimens during metamorphosis: At the end of the third-instar larval stage the puparium is formed.

            "Representative Results Normally cycling cells stained with propidium iodide have distinct peaks at G1 and G2, corresponding to cells containing 2N and 4N DNA content, respectively (Figure 2). Pulse labeling with BrdU allows for selective labeling of a sub-population of cells that are actively synthesizing DNA (i.e. S phase). Shortly after removal of the BrdU reagent, all labeled cells are in S phase (Figure 3). By restricting labeling to a short pulse one is able to follow this now distinct sub-population of cells throughout numerous time points as they pass through the subsequent phases of the cell cycle. This can be visualized at the 1 h time point in Figure 3 as a distinct lack of G1 and G2 peaks. Additional information can be derived from the BrdU labeling step. Not only can the proportion of actively dividing cells be measured, but an estimate of cell cycle stage distribution between two samples can be determined as well. By collecting cells at equally spaced intervals following the removal of the BrdU reagent, cells can be traced as they continue to cycle, progress to G2 and ultimately move through to cell division of the original cells, finally emerging as BrdU-positive daughter cells with G1 DNA content (Figure 4). An example of cell cycle phase quantification and kinetic analysis is provided in Figure 5. FL3-H:PI Figure 2. Representative histogram plot of a total population of normally cycling cells. eventcount =6950 # Discussion By combining flow cytometry with BrdU incorporation, we have the necessary tools to study cell cycle kinetics. The distinctive property of BrdU to function as a thymidine analogue is what allows for DNA content quantification of a cycling cell. The incorporation of BrdU into a growing daughter DNA strand during the synthesis phase of the cell cycle is what allows one to follow a subpopulation of cycling cells through the replication of DNA in S phase, to a period of growth at G2 and ultimately to cell division. Daughter BrdU-positive cells can be continuously followed until which point in time the BrdU label is diluted by cell division to the degree where the signal is reduced to background levels. Using propidium iodide to determine total DNA content, we are able to follow cell cycle progression from StoG2/MtoG . The ability to track the cycling rate of cells is important and useful in many applications, particularly for pre-clinical studies involving cell cycle specific DNA damage inducing drugs or during the drug development process to determine cell cycle stage sensitivity of novel compounds 11. The most obvious advantage of using a metabolic labeling technique is the elimination of chemical synchronization of cells. As most chemical treatments that induce cell cycle arrest are themselves genotoxic, dissecting the cell cycle sensitivity effects of novel compounds in the presence of these chemicals may not be feasible. We demonstrated the versatility of this BrdU metabolic labeling technique with PI co-staining. Using this protocol, we have successfully demonstrated that the increase in cell cycle progression through the G2/M phase of the cell cycle can be observed in telomerase-negative human cells that have been transformed to have forced enzyme expression10. While this method is powerful in measuring the kinetics of the cell as it cycles through multiple stages, one limitation is the loss of timing information during the transitions, as well as within the G2 and M phases. As cells proceed through G2 to M, we are unable to distinguish not only the two phases, but also the sub-G1 population, based solely on DNA content. In applications where this differentiation is required, it is potentially possible to co-stain BrdU labeled cells with antibodies against cyclins or other cellular proteins whose expressions are specific to the desired phase of the cell cycle 12,13. Additional optimization will be needed to ensure that the cyclin antibodies are compatible with the BrdU label and immuno-staining protocol. Ideally, to adequately differentiate the various phases of the cell cycle, several cyclin antibodies may be needed to co-label a single sample simultaneously. Our laboratory is working on the post-labeling of BrdU-pulse labeled cells with cyclin B and phospho Histone 3 antibodies to differentiate between cells in G2 versus M phase of the cell cycle. Co-labeling with cyclin antibodies, in addition to PI and FITC-BrdU staining substantially increases the complication of flow cytometry from both a hardware and data analysis (fluorescence compensation issues) perspective. With the advent of the new generation of flow cytometers, advances in their capacity and functionality should alleviate these technical concerns. # Disclosures We have nothing to disclose. # Acknowledgements We thank Andy Johnson of the Biomedical Research Center at UBC for assistance with FACS analysis.

We will not discuss the mathematical and statistical aspects of FRAP analyses here and refer the reader to other excellent publications4-9. The bleach depth refers to the distance (on the y_ -axis) between the pre-bleach (100%) signal and the first image after bleach; the mobile fraction refers to the distance (on the y. -axis) between the bleach depth and the recovered signal when the kinetics reaches a plateau, and the immobile fraction refers to the distance (on the y-axis) between the recovered signal and the pre-bleach (100%) signal (see Figures 1B and 2B). Beyond this analysis, there are good mathematical models to fit the data. For a single exponent, the equation =A(1-e-k_0#t) where t is time, A is the mobile fraction, 1-A is the immobile fraction and k_o# is the dissociation constant, can be used to fit the data, and a direct estimate of the off rate of binding (k_o#) can be obtained, as well as for the parameter A, which can be used to calculate the association rate.",

We will not discuss the mathematical and statistical aspects of FRAP analyses here and refer the reader to other excellent publications4-9. The bleach depth refers to the distance (on the y_ -axis) between the pre-bleach (100%) signal and the first image after bleach; the mobile fraction refers to the distance (on the y. -axis) between the bleach depth and the recovered signal when the kinetics reaches a plateau, and the immobile fraction refers to the distance (on the y-axis) between the recovered signal and the pre-bleach (100%) signal (see Figures 1B and 2B). Beyond this analysis, there are good mathematical models to fit the data. For a single exponent, the equation =A(1-e-k_0#t) where t is time, A is the mobile fraction, 1-A is the immobile fraction and k_o# is the dissociation constant, can be used to fit the data, and a direct estimate of the off rate of binding (k_o#) can be obtained, as well as for the parameter A, which can be used to calculate the association rate."

            "Fluorescent Microsphere Assay to Test Intestinal Motility Gavage provides enhanced control over timing and amount of material delivery to the intestine which makes it an ideal alternative method for intestinal motility studies. Previously published techniques for measuring intestinal motility in zebrafish larvae include direct observation of intestinal contractions and waves by microsco py1,21,36, or feeding larvae with food blended with yellow-green fluorescent polystyrene microspheres26. In some studies, quantitation of intestinal motility patterns has been enhanced by immersing larvae in media containing food dye37 or a specialized video analysis technique called spatiotemporal mapping38,39. Here we provide a proof-of-concept study to show that it is possible to gavage fluorescent microspheres into the intestinal anterior bulb, and tracking of microsphere movement can be utilized to assess intestinal motility (Figure 6). The primary difference between this method and the approach of Field and colleagues26 is that the beads are introduced alone and cannot be incorporated into food due to the gavage needle diameter limits.",

Also, the methods for needle loading and calibration will vary depending on the type of microinjection unit being used. We have optimized this protocol using Drummond II microinjectors, but we anticipate that this protocol will also be applicable to other microinjection instruments with minor modification. Since injection rigs and needle pullers will vary between labs, it will be important to measure/calibrate the injection volumes (see section 2.8).",
            "Dextran Assay to Test Gavage Safety and Intestinal Barrier Integrity Microgavage can be used to deliver diverse materials into the intestine. As an example, we provide a protocol below for gavaging a 10k D dextran conjugated to Texas Red to analyze barrier integrity of the intestinal epithelium. At least two potential routes of paracellular permeability exist, with differences in selectivity based on charge and size of the solutes, termed the \"pore\" or \"leak\" pathways29. Since this dextran is too large to be absorbed across the intestinal epithelium through the paracellular pore pathway (size limitation 4mathringA_i 10kD dextran= 23mathringA)9,30-32 , it should be retained within the lumen if intestinal barrier integrity is not compromised.

            "Dextran Assay to Test Gavage Safety and Intestinal Barrier Integrity Microgavage can be used to deliver diverse materials into the intestine. As an example, we provide a protocol below for gavaging a 10k D dextran conjugated to Texas Red to analyze barrier integrity of the intestinal epithelium. At least two potential routes of paracellular permeability exist, with differences in selectivity based on charge and size of the solutes, termed the \"pore\" or \"leak\" pathways29. Since this dextran is too large to be absorbed across the intestinal epithelium through the paracellular pore pathway (size limitation 4mathringA_i 10kD dextran= 23mathringA)9,30-32 , it should be retained within the lumen if intestinal barrier integrity is not compromised. Although 10k D dextran could be transported via the paracellular leak pathway, this pathway has lower capacity and slower kinetics29,33, and, therefore, is not likely to occur within the time-fra3m4,e3 5of this assay.

            "Fluorescent Microsphere Assay to Test Intestinal Motility Gavage provides enhanced control over timing and amount of material delivery to the intestine which makes it an ideal alternative method for intestinal motility studies. Previously published techniques for measuring intestinal motility in zebrafish larvae include direct observation of intestinal contractions and waves by microsco py1,21,36, or feeding larvae with food blended with yellow-green fluorescent polystyrene microspheres26. In some studies, quantitation of intestinal motility patterns has been enhanced by immersing larvae in media containing food dye37 or a specialized video analysis technique called spatiotemporal mapping38,39. Here we provide a proof-of-concept study to show that it is possible to gavage fluorescent microspheres into the intestinal anterior bulb, and tracking of microsphere movement can be utilized to assess intestinal motility (Figure 6). The primary difference between this method and the approach of Field and colleagues26 is that the beads are introduced alone and cannot be incorporated into food due to the gavage needle diameter limits."

            "Representative Results When cultured in a bottle, growth of M. tuberculosis can be seen at the base of the bottle by the end of the first week. By the end of the second week, patchy growth of bacteria on the air-media interface can be seen, although growth at the air-media interface is consistently visible at the end of the third week (Fig. 1A). At this time the attachment of the bacteria to the wall of the container is also observed. From this point onward the growth of the culture primarily occurs on the air-media interface. The liquid beneath the surface growth is clear. Typically, the structure matures by the end of the fifth week (Fig. 1B). If incubation is prolonged, the structures will begin to sink to the bottom of the container. Intriguingly, tightening of the cap until the end of third week is an important step in the process, and for unknown reasons a loose-capped bottle significantly retards initiation of growth on the interface . In the 12-well format, a robust biofilm at the air-media interface is seen in each of the wells at the end of five weeks (Fig 2A). If the plates are not wrapped completely then differential biofilm growth is observed. In the worst case, significant media evaporation can stall the growth of the bacteria (Fig 2B). Thus, wrapping of the plate is necessary both to prevent the evaporation as well as to provide environment for biofilm formation (see previous paragraph). The number of viable bacilli in biofilms determined with this technique is quite reproducible. Response of M. tuberculosis biofilms varies with the nature of the antibiotics. For a bactericidal antibiotic such as rifampicin, loss of viability follows a biphasic trend . A rapid decline in the viability during the first three to four days followed by a persistent phase in which a small percentage of the population remain completely recalcitrant to antibiotics irrespective of the concentration of the antibiotic or the time of exposure.

For the 2-IFC GOT task, we use square wave gratings that contact the distal pad of the finger with 4 cm/sec onset velocity, 50 gm contact force, and 1 sec contact duration. Each trial consists of two sequential stimulus presentations (ISI: 2 sec) with gratings of identical groove width, but differing 90-deg in orientation. In one presentation, the grooves are aligned vertically (parallel), and in the other, horizontally (transverse), to the long axis of the finger. Stimulus order is chosen randomly by the computer program. The subject indicates whether the horizontal orientation occurred in the first or second interval, by pressing one of two buttons with the non-tested hand. A Bayesian adaptive method adjusts groove width from trial to trial. We programmed TAPS with a modified version of the psi () method, a Bayesian adaptive algorithm3. This method has several advantages over conventional adaptive methods, such as staircase methods. First, the psi method estimates not just a single point on the psychometric function (e.g., the 71% threshold estimated by a 2-down 1-up staircase), but the entire psychometric function. Second, the method yields Bayesian posterior probability distributions (and thereby confidence intervals) for the parameters of the psychometric function. Finally, the method is efficient. It holds in memory many thousands of possible psychometric function shapes, and updates the posterior probability of each function after each response. It then uses an expected entropy minimization procedure to choose the next stimulus; that is, it chooses the stimulus on each trial that is expected to maximize the information gain. Following Kontsevich and Tyler3, we modeled d-prime as a power function of stimulus level, and each subject's psychometric function – P_c(x) , the probability of a correct response as a function of stimulus level, x – as a mixture of a cumulative normal (probit) function and a lapse rate term: d=(fracxa)b P_c(x)=frac2+(1-)frac1sqrt2int_-inftydexpiggl(-fracy22iggr)d y Here, a is the threshold (stimulus level corresponding to 76% correct response probability, d-prime =1 ), and b is the slope, of the subject's psychometric function. We modified the  algorithm by treating the lapse rate (delta) as a parameter of unknown value, and by calculating a \"guessing Bayes factor\" after each trial: B_12=fracP(D c h a n c e)P(D(a,b,)* This Bayes factor is a likelihood ratio that compares the probability of the data under hypothesis 1, that the subject is guessing, to the probability of the data under hypothesis 2, that the subject has a psychometric function. The numerator is the probability of the subject's data, D (correct and incorrect responses at each of the groove widths presented) given that the subject is simply guessing 50% probability correct) on all trials up to and including the current trial. The denominator is the probability of the data given the algorithm's best estimate of the subject's psychometric function. In our experience, for most young subjects the Bayes factor rapidly approaches zero as the testing block progresses, indicating that the subject's performance conforms to a psychometric function. For some older subjects, the Bayes factor rises above one, indicating that the subject is unable to perform the task. TAPS can be programmed to terminate the testing block if the guessing Bayes factor has exceeded a threshold value after a specified number of trials",
            "Components and Details of Device Function # i. Moving Parts TAPS uses two stepper motors, one to drive the carriage of the linear actuator, and another to rotate the disk containing the stimulus pieces. These two motors control all of TAPS' moving parts. These parts lie on a lower table that is mechanically uncoupled from the upper table on which the subject's arm rests. Because the two tables are uncoupled, vibrations caused by the motors do not transfer to the skin. The tables are carefully aligned so that the tunnel through the upper table lies directly above the stimulus piece contacted by the rotating rod. We machined 40 square slots around the circumference of the rotating disk, to accommodate the stimulus pieces. We constructed stimulus pieces from round plastic rods, machining the rods to have square shafts that fit into the slots of the disk. This ensures that the pieces do not rotate within their slots as the disk spins. We cut the stimulus surfaces into the round faces of the pieces. When the actuator carriage motors forward, the end of the rotating rod opposite the hanging mass rises to contact the bottom of the selected stimulus piece. Because the rod describes an arc as it swings upwards, it is fit with a lightweight plastic bearing wheel to eliminate friction with the bottom of the stimulus piece. This plastic wheel rotates slightly as it pushes the stimulus piece upward; without the plastic wheel, the end of the rod would pull the base of the piece slightly laterally (towards the left in Fig. 1), causing the piece to jam within the tunnel through the upper table. To further ensure a smooth upward trajectory of the piece, the tunnel is fit with a plastic collar that is beveled to direct the piece towards the center of the tunnel as the piece rises. # ii. Sensors TAPS makes use of six sensors to ensure proper functioning: two home sensors, three limit sensors, and a force sensor. The actuator and disk home sensors signal to the computer that the actuator carriage and the disk are in their desired initial positions at the start of an experiment. The actuator home sensor is a Hall-effect sensor; the disk home sensor is a U-shaped photoelectric sensor, activated when a piece of stiff paper glued to the disk rim breaks the infrared sensor beam. When the disk is in home position, a particular slot is aligned directly under the tunnel in the upper table. All subsequent disk movement calculations are made relative to this known starting position. The three limit sensors serve as safety features in case of malfunction. To prevent runaway movement of the actuator carriage in the unlikely event of a control malfunction, the actuator is fit with forward and reverse limit sensors (Hall-effect sensors). If activated, these cut power to the actuator. To prevent disk movement in the event that a stimulus piece becomes stuck in the tunnel, an infrared retro-reflective sensor is attached to the underside surface of the upper table. A piece that is elevated sufficiently to enter the tunnel breaks the infrared beam cast by this sensor, and blocks command voltages from reaching the disk stepper motor. The sixth and final sensor is a force sensor that rests gently on the subject's fingernail (Fig. 2). This sensor detects downward (into the tunnel), backward or forward finger movement. The program discards trials in which movement occurred. Because the sensor is attached to a rigid arm, it additionally prevents the finger from moving passively upwards upon contact with the rising piece. Since we use TAPS to test passive (finger stationary) tactile spatial acuity, the force sensor is a crucial element. As a final precaution against finger movement, we place plastic barriers gently against the sides of the finger to prevent lateral movements. # iii. Vibration and Sound Damping TAPS' stepper motors produce vibration, and this in turn causes sound. Both vibration and sound are undesirable. Vibration, if transmitted to the skin, could interfere with the subject's ability to perform the tactile task. Over time, vibration could also cause mechanical instability in TAPS' components. Sound could distract the subject. For these reasons, we have taken measures to reduce both vibration and sound, and to prevent any vibration from reaching the subject. Most importantly, the lower and upper tables do not contact one another. They are connected only in the sense that they both contact the floor. Hence, vibration from the motors, which rest on the lower table, is not transmitted to the subject's arm, which rests on the upper table. Additionally, vibration and sound are reduced as follows: a fiberglass curtain enclosing the lower table muffles device sound; PVC/fiber reinforced anti-vibration pads sandwiched between the actuator and its base absorb some of the actuator-produced vibration; the actuator base sits on four rubber cylindrical sandwich mounts that serve to further dampen vibration; the disk stepper motor base also sits on rubber mounts (syringe plunger rubber); and silicone O-rings surround the shafts of the stimulus pieces, reducing clatter as the disk turns. # iv. Stimulus Pieces TAPS uses modified half-inch diameter rods to press spatially structured surfaces against the skin (Fig. 3). The rods are machined to have square shafts. The round faces of the rods contain the stimulus surfaces; the square shafts of the rods fit into the 40 square slots around the circumference of the rotating disk, ensuring that the stimulus surfaces maintain their proper orientations as the disk spins. Any stimulus surfaces may be machined into the rod faces. We have used TAPS mainly to apply square wave gratings (i.e., parallel ridges and grooves). To create these, we started with 0.5\" diameter Delrin plastic cylindrical rods, 3\" long. Using a Sherline milling machine, we cut the rods to 2.75\" long, with z\" long square-cross-section shafts (8.7×8.7mm) , and a 0.75n. -long, 12.74mm diameter round cylindrical head. We then milled grooves in the round face to create the stimulus surfaces. Each stimulus surface has equal ridge and groove widths. We made pieces with groove widths ranging from 0.25 to 3.10:m m in 0.15:mm increments. We made two identical stimulus pieces for each of these 20 groove widths, resulting in 40 pieces total. We then inserted the pieces into the square slots of the disk such that each groove width was represented in both the vertical (parallel to long axis of the finger) and horizontal (transverse to the long axis of the finger) orientation. # v. Computer Control TAPS is a fully automated, computer-controlled system. Many computer hardware and software configurations could be used to control the device. We currently use a Macintosh G3 running LabVIEW 6.1 (National Instruments). The computer communicates via a motor controller board with a stepper motor driver to command the actuator and disk motors, and to read the home sensors and limit switches. A PCI data acquisition board reads the force sensor and subject response buttons. # vi. Force and Timing Limitations Force range: We have used TAPS to deliver stimuli with forces ranging from 10 to 50 grams. We suspect that friction in the components would impede the delivery of stimuli at forces under about 5 grams, and that some mechanical instability would arise for forces in excess of about 100 grams. Inter-stimulus interval (ISI): The distance between the stimulus surfaces and the finger, and the stable speeds of the linear actuator and disk stepper motor, together set a lower limit on the ISI that the device can achieve. We estimate this limit at about 1.5 seconds. Thus, the device is not appropriate for applications such as masking experiments, which require sub-second ISI",
            "Device Overview TAPS uses gravity to press a stimulus surface against the skin (Fig. 1). The subject's arm rests comfortably in prone position on a tabletop. The fingertip (or other skin area to be tested) lies over a tunnel in the table. Beneath the table, a stepper motor rotates a disk that holds up to 40 stimulus pieces, positioning one of the pieces under the tunnel. Gravity exerts a downward force on a mass hanging from one end of a rotatable rod. A crossbar extending from the carriage of a linear actuator prevents the rod from moving. As the actuator motors forward, the rod pivots under the influence of gravity, pressing a stimulus piece upward through the tunnel and onto the skin. Simple physics relates the speed of the actuator to the speed with which the stimulus surface rises to contact the skin, and the weight of the hanging mass to the static force of the tactile stimulus. As the actuator reverses direction to return the rod to its starting position, the stimulus piece drops. Thus, the device applies tactile stimuli with controlled force, velocity, contact duration, and inter-stimulus interval. The subject selects a button with the non-tested hand to register a response. TAPS detects the response and proceeds to deliver the next stimulus. Onset velocity: As the crossbar from the linear actuator (red) moves to the right with velocity V_1 , the left end of the rotating rod drops under the influence of gravity; the right end of the rod therefore presses a stimulus piece upwards towards the finger with velocity V_2=V_1(L_2/L_3) . Since V_1 is under computer control, V_2 may be set to any value desired by the investigator. Force: Gravity exerts a downward force, F_1=Mg , on the mass M (where g=9.8m/s2) . This causes the stimulus piece to press against the finger with an upward force, F_2 . For a massless rod, F_2=F_1(L_1/L_2) . Since the rod is not in fact massless, F_2 is determined empirically, by measurement with a force sensor. To make fine adjustments to F_2 , the investigator can change the position of M along the rod. F_2 increases slightly as M is moved to the left (increasing L_1 ), and decreases slightly as M is moved to the right (decreasing L_1 ). To make larger adjustments to F_2 , the mass can be changed",

Temperature control is achieved by placing slides on a heated stage maintained at 30°C by the PeCon Tempcontrol 37 device. In order to avoid re-adjusting the focus repeatedly, it is convenient to program the image acquisition software to automatically acquire a few zstack images at every time-point and choose the image with the best focus later when assembling the movie. Some image acquisition softwares have the option of autofocus for time course experiments. It is convenient to use that option in when available. Wild type yeast cells grow best at 30°C hence temperature control is critical. In order to ensure adequate heat, it is helpful to provide an external source of heat in addition to the heated stage. For example, we leave the transmitted white light of the microscope on for the entire duration of imaging. It is also critical to avoid air-bubbles when preparing the agarose bed and cell sandwich. The air entrapped within the bubbles expands when heated over time and tend to push cells away from the field being imaged. It is also important to ensure that individual cell positions within the field do not change appreciably over the duration of the imaging process, especially during re-focusing attempts.

            "Representative Results: Oxygen consumption in properly prepared murine cardiac fibers is evaluated by the quality control protocol as shown in Figure 2. Figures 3-5 provide commonly encountered examples of incorrectly prepared cardiac fibers. The respiratory control ratio (RCR) represents an important index in respirometry. This parameter indicates the coupling between oxygen consumption and oxidative phosphorylation. In permeabilized fiber preparations, the RCR is the rate of respiration in state 3 relative to state 2 or alternatively state 3 over state 4 (induced by oligomycin and/or atractyloside, ATR). Furthermore, RCR can be used as a quality assurance marker and can identify changes in coupling resulting from experimental or pathological interventions5. Well-coupled permeabilized murine cardiac preparations yield an RCR between 3-6 depending on the incubation solution utilized1, 8, 9. The titration of cytochrome c is used as a validation of proper tissue preparation. Cytochrome c is a protein located in the intermembrane space at the mitochondrial inner membrane10. When the outer membrane of mitochondria is intact, the endogenous cytochrome c remains in the intermembrane space and the titration of exogenous cytochrome c has a negligible effect on respiration (Figure 2). If the outer membrane of mitochondria is damaged, the endogenous cytochrome c can be released from the intermembrane space and will inhibit respiration until exogenous cytochrome c addition (Figure 3). Proper preparations should experience only a slight elevation in oxygen flux following cytochrome c addition in the 5-15% range5. Additionally, this experimental titration allows for the assessment of the pathological or experimental stressor's influence on mitochondrial outer membrane intactness. If a cytochrome c effect is experienced, ensure care during mechanical preparation of the tissue and/or reduce saponin concentration. The addition of oligomycin and/or ATR is used to assess alterations in leak respiration; oxygen consumption not contributing to ADP phosphorylation11. Additionally, this titration step may be used as a validation of proper sample preparation. Control or wild-type fibers should be sensitive to this addition and experience a significant reduction in oxygen flux. A low RCR and reduced sensitivity to oligomycin and/or ATR resulting in a relatively elevated oxygen flux indicates damage to the inner mitochondrial membrane during preparation (Figure 4). Damage is likely induced during mechanical separation of the cardiac fibers as the inner mitochondrial membrane is less susceptible to insult by saponin relative to the outer mitochondrial membrane. However, both mechanical and chemical preparation may have to be adjusted accordingly to avoid improperly prepared cardiac fibers5, 12. The saponin-skinned fiber bundles from mice should not remain in the RP solution for more than 6h or the MiR05 solution for greater than 2h. Lack of response to substrate-inhibitor-uncoupler titrations as seen in Figure 5 may be indicative of prolonged incubation periods. Subsequent efforts should minimize periods between animal sacrifice and oxygen consumption measurements. mL closed chamber is identified by the blue line. Oxygen consumption of the cardiac tissue sample in a 2 mL closed chamber is represented by the red line. Malate and glutamate, M/G; Adenosine Diphosphate, ADP Oligomycin, o.",

If the outer membrane of mitochondria is damaged, the endogenous cytochrome c can be released from the intermembrane space and will inhibit respiration until exogenous cytochrome c addition (Figure 3). Proper preparations should experience only a slight elevation in oxygen flux following cytochrome c addition in the 5-15% range5. Additionally, this experimental titration allows for the assessment of the pathological or experimental stressor's influence on mitochondrial outer membrane intactness. If a cytochrome c effect is experienced, ensure care during mechanical preparation of the tissue and/or reduce saponin concentration. The addition of oligomycin and/or ATR is used to assess alterations in leak respiration; oxygen consumption not contributing to ADP phosphorylation11. Additionally, this titration step may be used as a validation of proper sample preparation. Control or wild-type fibers should be sensitive to this addition and experience a significant reduction in oxygen flux. A low RCR and reduced sensitivity to oligomycin and/or ATR resulting in a relatively elevated oxygen flux indicates damage to the inner mitochondrial membrane during preparation (Figure 4). Damage is likely induced during mechanical separation of the cardiac fibers as the inner mitochondrial membrane is less susceptible to insult by saponin relative to the outer mitochondrial membrane. However, both mechanical and chemical preparation may have to be adjusted accordingly to avoid improperly prepared cardiac fibers5, 12. The saponin-skinned fiber bundles from mice should not remain in the RP solution for more than 6h or the MiR05 solution for greater than 2h. Lack of response to substrate-inhibitor-uncoupler titrations as seen in Figure 5 may be indicative of prolonged incubation periods. Subsequent efforts should minimize periods between animal sacrifice and oxygen consumption measurements. mL closed chamber is identified by the blue line. Oxygen consumption of the cardiac tissue sample in a 2 mL closed chamber is represented by the red line. Malate and glutamate, M/G; Adenosine Diphosphate, ADP Oligomycin, o."

The geometry is similar to those described in 3, 4, except that the walls in the expansions and contractions are formed by a series of discrete “staircase” steps due to the alignment of discrete plates rather than smooth diagonal surfaces.

            "Use a CAD program to design the mixing sections of the static mixer. The SAR mixer is composed of a number of different plate geometries; these geometries are shown in Fig. 3. Each laser-cut Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) plate is 1.59:mm thick and has a rectangular key at the bottom so that it can be aligned in a PVC pipe with an acrylic rod. The geometry is similar to those described in 3, 4, except that the walls in the expansions and contractions are formed by a series of discrete “staircase” steps due to the alignment of discrete plates rather than smooth diagonal surfaces. Although the material of construction here is PMMA and PVC, opaque non-metallic mixers can be constructed as well.",

To remove the endothelium, carefully untie the artery from the outflow pipette and slowly perfuse the lumen of the artery with an air bolus (0.5-1.0m L) ). After air perfusion, restore PSS perfusion to clear the cellular debris before re-tying the vessel to the outflow pipette . NOTE: Following the endothelial denudation procedure, it is important to verify that the endothelium is removed by testing vascular responses to an agonist (usually ACh) known to produce endothelium dependent vasodilation in that vessel type. However, in certain pathologic conditions, endothelium-dependent vasoconstrictors are released, in which case, it is important to verify that the constrictor response is eliminated following endothelial removal.",

Tie off any branches or check for holes in the vessel if the pressure falls. Restore perfusion after verifying that the transmural pressure remains constant. NOTE: Cannulation of isolated resistance arteries requires manual dexterity and practice. The main precautions to be observed are to avoid breaking the pipettes and to make sure that the artery does not slide off the pipettes. It is important to be gentle with the isolated arteries throughout the entire procedure, as trauma to the vessel can damage the endothelium and/or interfere with normal function of the vascular smooth muscle.",

Discard any arteries lacking active tone at rest with the exception of vessels, e.g., small mesenteric arteries that do not normally exhibit active resting tone. NOTE: For vessels that do not normally exhibit spontaneous tone, pre-constrict the arteries by an equivalent amount utilizing a vasoconstrictor agonist such as norepinephrine or phenylephrine. A good approach to choosing the dose of the agonist used to pre-constrict the artery is to utilize an E C_50 dose of the vasoconstrictor agent, e.g., norepinephrine41,42.

NOTE: For vessels that do not normally exhibit spontaneous tone, pre-constrict the arteries by an equivalent amount utilizing a vasoconstrictor agonist such as norepinephrine or phenylephrine. A good approach to choosing the dose of the agonist used to pre-constrict the artery is to utilize an E C_50 dose of the vasoconstrictor agent, e.g., norepinephrine41,42.

In the oxy-hemoglobin response, there is first a characteristic dip. This dip occurs as a region of neurons activates and depletes available oxygen. As blood flow increases, carrying oxygenated hemoglobin, the oxyhemoglobin response rises rapidly above the initial baseline levels to a steady state level.

It is recommended to conduct the entire transfection/infection procedure using a GFP expressing virus every single reprogramming experiment to monitor the efficiency as shown in Figure 1. The titer of the GFP expressing virus determined, as described in , through the transduction of human fibroblasts using nonconcentrated viral media was typically in the range of 0.5-5×107 viral particles per ml (vp/ml). Fibroblasts change morphology as early as 2 days after the last infection. Trypsinized human fibroblasts should be carefully counted prior to seeding them on the MEF feeder cells. It is recommended to seed cells at 3 different densities (6×103 , 1.2×104 , 2.5×104 per single well of a 6 well plate) since each cell line demonstrates different growth characteristic and seeding density is critical for the efficiency of reprogramming. Sodium butyrate used for the initial 7-14 days of reprogramming increases the efficiency of hiPSC formation approximately 5 fold. Frequently, especially when infected fibroblasts were seeded at higher density, the fibroblast-like cells can overgrow a culture dish and cover hiPSC colonies as shown in Figure 2A. In this case, the fibroblast layer can be carefully lifted and removed to uncover hiPSC colonies (Figure 2B). Subsequently, hiPSC colonies should be rinsed with hES media and stained with Tra-1-81 antibody. Depending on the fibroblast cells, approximately 20-40% of colonies demonstrating with iPSC-like morphology do not stain with Tra-1-81 antibody. Identified hiPSC colonies can be transferred from a plate within next 12 - 24h. Prolonged incubation will result in rapid differentiation of hiPSCs. Colonies can be manually passaged onto either MEF feeder cells or Matrigel-coated plates. After expansion established hiPSC clones should be tested using immunocytochemistry (ICC) for the expression of pluripotency markers as demonstrated in Figure 3. Additionally, a detailed molecular characterization of the generated iPS cell lines should include: analyses of the pluripotency gene expression using RT-PCR, demonstration of the DNA demethylation at the promoters of pluripotency genes and analyses of the transgenes silencing"

Add 400ul of trypsin-EDTA and incubate the dish at 37°C under 5% C O_2 atmosphere for 5 min to allow cells to detach from the dish. 3. Stop the enzyme digestion by adding 1ml of cold culture medium without PS and wash out all the cells from the surface by pipetting gently 4-5 times. Avoid over-digestion and over-pipetting to reduce cell death. 4. Collect cells in 1.5m tubes and place immediately on ice. Use ice cold solutions and keep the cells at 4°C to prevent the internalization of surface antigens. Decrease lighting to limit photobleaching of the fluorescent signal. 5.

At baseline, we observed a high percentage of unstimulated cells with the transcription factor NF- K B (p65) in the cytoplasm. After stimulation, treated cells have a significantly higher similarity score of NF-B (p65) with nuclear stain PI, indicating that NF-κB (p65) translocated into the nucleus after stimulation (median similarity scores are 1.52 and 3.01, respectively, Fig. 2).

        "question": "Please sort the following steps titled 'Cerebral aneurysms are abnormal widening or ballooning of a localized segment of an intracranial blood vessel. These lesions typically occur at branch points of the parent vessel as a result of progressive weakening of the arterial wall. Cerebral aneurysms are most commonly detected after the aneurysm ruptures causing subarachnoid hemorrhage. This form of intracranial hemorrhage carries a 45% risk of mortality within the first month after rupture and survivors often experience severe permanent neurologic injury. Recently, due to the increased use of advanced imaging modalities such as MRI and CT scan, cerebral aneurysms are frequently identified prior to rupture and options for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms include surgical clipping and coil embolization. In this video report, we describe the microsurgical clipping of a middle cerebral artery aneurysm utilizing an ultrasonic perivascular probe for blood vessel flow assessment. The goal of surgical clipping of a cerebral aneurysm is to definitively remove the aneurysm from the circulation while preserving blood flow through the parent and distal arteries. Typically, the operating microscope is used to provide improved visualization of the aneurysm and enable successful dissection of the aneurysm and placement of a titanium clip at its base. Improper clip placement may result in residual aneurysm or partial or full occlusion of distal arteries, potentially causing cerebral infarction. Several studies using intraoperative angiography during aneurysm surgery have demonstrated the inadequacy of direct visual inspection at predicting the maintenance of adequate blood flow in the parent and distal arteries2,3. Despite its utility, intraoperative angiography carries the risk of arterial injury or stroke and its widespread availability is limited4. In this report, we describe the use of an ultrasonic flow probe to provide quantitative intraoperative assessment of blood flow following the surgical clipping of an aneurysm. The Transonic flow probe uses transit-time technology to measure blood flow. The probe uses two transducers to alternatively transmit and receive ultrasonic signal in both the upstream and downstream directions with respect to blood flow5. The flow-meter then measures the transit time for a wave of ultrasound to travel the fixed distance between the transducers. The difference between the upstream and downstream integrated transit times is a measure of blood flow. Quantitative flow measurements are performed in the parent and distal vessels prior to aneurysm clipping and then reassessed after the clip has been applied to ensure preservation of blood flow6-8. If blood flow is decreased, the clip may then be readjusted as necessary. As seen in this video, surgical obliteration a middle cerebral artery aneurysm is performed and quantitative assessment of blood flow using the ultrasonic probe enables confirmation of preserved flow through the distal arteries supplying the brain, thus enabling the avoidance of neurologic complication from improper surgical clip placement. # References' in the correct order.",

Therefore, Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) practices need to be followed when conducting M. tuberculosis research in an annually certified laboratory. Exposure to laboratory-generated aerosols is the most important hazard encountered by personnel working with these microorganisms. The following procedures are conducted at our institution and variations may exist based on the Institutional Biosafety Committee's recommendations. Common personnel protective equipment will consist of a Tyvek suit, bouffant cap, booties, N95 respirator, eye protection, sleeves, and a double pair of nitrile gloves. Work involving M. tuberculosis cultures and/or manipulations with open M. tuberculosis containers is performed in the type A2 or B2 biological safety cabinet. Plastic-covered absorbent paper is placed on the working surface. All materials/supplies to be disposed or removed from the facility must be placed in two biohazard bags and decontaminated by autoclaving. Work surfaces and equipment utilized within the cabinet (FastPrep-24 lysis homogenizer, spectrophotometer, bucket with ice, etc.) must be disinfected after each work session with 1% Amphyl (tuberculocidal, bactericidal, fungicidal, and virucidal agent). M. tuberculosis cultures must be placed under double containment for transportation to larger equipment located outside of the biological safety cabinet such as freezers, incubators, centrifuges, and refrigerators. Centrifugation is conducted with enclosed safety cups and O-ring screw top tubes. For further analysis outside the BSL3 laboratory, cell-free extracts are filtered through a 0.2um filter or microorganisms heat killed at 95°C for 15m i n .

Provide bees with a source of water and food while housed in the lab. For example, at a minimum, provide access to a 50% (w/v) solution of sucrose in water (this is sufficient for durations of less than 6hr ). For longer periods, provide bees access to honey. 2.
